                <p>A startapp I co-founded with former university classmates, which focuses on providing
                  agri-tech solutions to small-scale and middle-scale farmers.
                  I was the Computer Aided Design lead, a role which entailed drafting CAD designs and overseeing their
                  fabrication to ensure accurate implementation of the designs.
                </p>
                <p>I also played a secondary role in firmware development, assisting in writing code for the products we were developing.</p>
