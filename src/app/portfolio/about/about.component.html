                      <p class="pt-4"> I am a full-stack software developer with an undergraduate degree in Mechatronic
                        Engineering,
                        a course that primarily focuses on automation of hardware systems. </p>
                      <p>
                        Throughout my studies, I was always an avid firmware (software for hardware) developer and this
                        showed in the number of automation projects I undertook.
                        On completion, I decided to further pursue my interest in programming and thus my journey into
                        software development began.</p>

                      <p class="pt-4"> I recently (August, 2019) completed an intensive 6-month software development
                        bootcamp
                        (Moringa School), where I sharpened my skills in Python and Javascript programming. <br>
                        I am currently proficient in using Angular as a frontend framework and Django & Flask as backend
                        frameworks. I am however open to taking up the challenge of learning new tech stacks based on the need.
